\section{Introduction}

In recent years, mobile communication tools have gained massively in
popularity. Some of these applications have more hundreds of millions of
downloads. This is important for forensics purposes because there are
reasonable odds that a suspect has installed and possibly used one such
application. For example, {\it imo.im} has over half a billion installs and
requests location permissions: if this application logs one's location, this
could be helpful for an investigation to either confirm alibies or to call
false ones into question.


\section{Research Questions}

Our main research question is:
{\it What locally stored information can be gathered from the Android imo messenger app?}

\vspace{0.5cm}

This main research question divides in five sub-questions:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Message data
	\item Location data
	\item Cached files/images
\end{enumerate}


\section{Scope}

We limit ourselves to the investigation of the imo Android app and do not look
into the iOS, MacOS or Windows versions.
