\section{Introduction}

In recent years, mobile communication tools have gained massively in
popularity. Some of these applications have more hundreds of millions of
downloads. This is important for forensics purposes because there are
reasonable odds that a suspect has installed and possibly used one such
application. For example, {\it imo.im} has around half a billion installs and
requests location permissions: if this application logs one's location, this
could be helpful for an investigation to either confirm alibies or to call
false ones into question.


\section{Research Questions}

Our main research question is:
{\it todo}

\vspace{0.5cm}

This main research question divides in five sub-questions:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item todo 
\end{enumerate}


\section{Methods and Scope}

We will do both static and dynamic analysis of the application. The scope will
be limited to the Android application. We will look at the stable release, not
any (potentially volatile) beta releases.

The main interest is the network traffic and stored data. If network data is
not (correctly) encrypted or otherwise revealing, this could be useful in an
active investigation. Stored data is useful for analysis after confiscating a
device.

To access both the image and network traffic, we will run the application in an
Android emulator. This allows the host to capture traffic, as well as mount the
disk image.
