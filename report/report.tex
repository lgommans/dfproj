\section{Introduction}

In recent years, mobile communication tools have gained massively in popularity.
Many mobile device users nowadays use internet based third party messaging
applications over the small message service (SMS) provided by telecom companies.
The advantage of these internet based alternatives is often the more extensive
features an lower cost compared to SMS. It is therefore unsurprising that many
such applications have over hundreds of millions of downloads, making the use of
them widespread. This fact is important for forensics purposes because there are
reasonable odds that a suspect has installed and possibly used at least one such
application to send or receive sensitive data relevant to the case. The
investigation into what data useful in a forensic investigation can be gathered
from such applications, therefore becomes very relevant.

One example of such an application is {\it imo.im}, which currently has over
half a billion installs on the Google Play Store. Fewer than ten messaging
applications have over half a billion installs as of October
2017\cite{wiki-gplay-popular}. It appears most popular in southern Asia and the
middle east, though there are users worldwide\footnotemark. This application
requests permission to track the user's location, making it even more
interesting for forensic purposes. If the application indeed tracks and stores
a log of a user's location data, such data could be valuable in court to for
instance validate or invalidate a suspect's alibi.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: the next section briefly
introduces the features of imo. Section \ref{sec:researchq} describes our main
research question and the defined sub-questions. In Section \ref{sec:ethics} we
discuss the ethical implications of our work. Section \ref{sec:relwork} gives
an overview of the prior work done in this area of research. %TODO

\section{Overview of imo}

Creating an account on imo is the same procedure as logging into your account
on a new device: you enter your phone number and enter the confirmation sms
code. There are no other types of accounts possible, e.g. no username and
password login.

Contacts in imo are added through your Android phone book. You can send those
contacts text messages, or place (video) calls. You can also share a `story',
which is a graphical message shared with all your contacts. It can consist of a
picture, short video, drawing, etc. Contacts can view your stories and send a
response. These responses appear in the chat history as a reply, referencing
your story.

When chatting, the message you are typing is immediately visible to the other
party, before even sending it. This feature is called `Real time chat'. Sending
a message makes it final: it cannot be edited afterwards, and one can only
delete it locally.

Imo also supports group chats and group calls. Compared to regular chats, we
did not find these to have any special features.

Finally, imo supports what are called `stickers': large, animated emoticons. 
These are placed in a chat as a message by themselves.


\section{Research Questions}\label{sec:researchq}

Our main research question is:
{\it What information can be gathered from the `imo' messenger app for Android?}

This main research question divides in four sub-questions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What data is identifiably sent over the network?
    \item What message data is available locally?
    \item What location data is available locally?
    \item Do any cached files or images exist locally?
\end{enumerate}


\section{Ethical Considerations}\label{sec:ethics}

For this paper we will use a test environment to examine the data that can be
extracted from the imo android app. We will not be using any real user data and
use only designated test devices to make sure we do not invade or compromise the
privacy of any real imo users.


\section{Related work}\label{sec:relwork}

No prior work has been done on the imo messaging app for any platform, the only
mention of imo in academic literature is in the paper by \citeauthor{zhu}, which
does a more general review of several group messaging applications and does not
conduct an analysis of what data can be acquired for use in a criminal
investigation \cite{zhu}.

Fortunately academic research does exist on the forensic investigation of other
messaging applications. \citeauthor{mahajan2013forensic} conduct a forensic
analysis of the Android messaging applications Viber and Whatsapp
\cite{mahajan2013forensic}. The aim of their paper is to find whether the data
of those applications, such as sent and received messages and images, are stored
locally in a way that they can be extracted from the device.
\citeauthor{mahajan2013forensic} managed to find and extract several artifacts
relevant to a forensic investigation, such as sent and received messages and
contact phone numbers.

\citeauthor{walnycky2015network} conduct an extensive investigation of 20
popular Android messaging applications \cite{walnycky2015network}. In their
paper they investigate what data is can be retrieved by investigating the mobile
device's local storage, the applications' server storage and network traffic
analysis in a forensic investigation for each application. Network traffic is
analysed using three different tools, Wireshark, NetworkMiner and NetWitness
Investigator, for the purpose of cross referencing the results. Server stored
data was investigated by recovering links to the applications' servers from the
network traffic analysis. Locally stored data was acquired and investigated
using Micro-systemation's {\it XRY} and verified by also using {\it Helium
backup} in combination with {\it Android backup extractor} and an sqlite
database browser.  In their paper, \citeauthor{walnycky2015network} state that 4
of the applications leaked no data when subjected to their investigative
methods.  However, their study did find that 16 applications do leak data either
through network communication or local/server storage.

A forensic investigation of WhatsApp is also conducted by
\citeauthor{anglano2014forensic} \cite{anglano2014forensic}, who uses a virtual
Android environment created with {\it YouWave} to investigate what data can be
acquired from WhatsApp through a device's local storage. Their study shows that
it is very feasible to acquire WhatsApp data from local storage, since data such
as sent and received messages and contact information is stored unencrypted on
the local storage.


\section{Method}\label{sec:method}

%todo investigate deleted messages, appear in database?
%todo investigate logout etc
%todo we do not focus on the proper forensic extraction methods but rather on
%the data that is available after such extraction has taken place
%todo add more phone numbers, can we see only phones from contact database or
%also users added manually on imo not in the phone's contacts.
%todo can we see own user telephone number/username



\section{Network Communication Analysis}\label{sec:comm}

The regular network communication (e.g. chats) was observed to use TCP ports
443, 5223 and 5228. We have not been able to identify why the app sometimes
uses one port over the other. In the APK, we find references to those three
ports together, so we are confident that there are no other TCP ports in use.
Searching online for those ports, we find that these ports overlap with
WhatsApp, C2DM (now-defunct server-push platform provided by Google, using port
5228) and Apple's push implementation (APNS, using port 5223). Most likely, imo
uses those ports because they are commonly used by mobile devices for core
operating system features (server push) or other popular applications. Network
administrators are unlikely to block those ports.

The downloading of stickers is done over plain HTTP. Anyone observing the
network traffic can therefore see which emoticons are used by a device. It is
not visible, however, which chat a sticker was used in.
%TODO: ^downloaded only once?

UDP is used for voice and video calls, using various ports. The choice of UDP
port seems random for the server, though we have also twice observed the server
to use UDP port 443 which seems too specific to be a coincidence, particularly
because it happened twice. The lowest port observed, other than 443, is 29 879.
Possibly a port is picked above a certain number to avoid conflicts with
existing services.

The Android client also appears to choose ports at random, though the lowest we
have observed was 33 419. We theorize that a random port is chosen above 32 000
to avoid using another application's port.

The clients involved in a call will try to reach each other directly for voice
and video calls. The communication goes through imo's servers by default, but
the app keeps trying to communicate peer to peer throughout the whole session
(it sends a packet twice per second). If this succeeds, it will switch to peer
to peer communication. Calls continue to work if the internet connection is
disrupted, but the users are on the same LAN.


\subsection{Communication format}

The stickers are downloaded over TCP port 80, using HTTP/1.1. A sticker is a
zip archive with one image, in png format, per frame of the animation. The
filenames are sequential numbers: \texttt{1.png}, \texttt{2.png}, etc. When the
user is picking a sticker, the previews are downloaded as a single image over
HTTP (rather than the full animation in a zip archive).

When the app chooses to use port 443, the connection is secured using TLSv1.2.
The client offers 20 cipher suites, among which obsolete ciphers such as
\texttt{TLS\_RSA\_WITH\_RC4\_128\_SHA} and
\texttt{TLS\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_128\_CBC\_SHA}, though this is probably dependent
on the operating system. In our case, the server picked
\texttt{TLS\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_128\_GCM\_SHA256}, which is labeled by Mozilla as
a ciphersuite of intermediate strength\cite{moz-tls}.

When the app choses to use one of the two alternative TCP ports (5223 or 5228),
the connection is encoded using an unknown method. The data is binary and could
be compressed, encrypted or both. When sending multiple kilobytes of repeating
characters, the observed traffic is much smaller, leading us to believe the
data is compressed. It is unknown whether the traffic is also encrypted.

We have not been able to identify the protocol used for UDP traffic. For the
traffic which is sent over port 443, we tried to decode it using Wireshark as
DTLS and QUIC traffic, but neither was successful. The traffic also does not
contain any strings, such as the common name or issuer name from a certificate,
which should have been visible for normal TLS or QUIC traffic.


\section{Local Storage Analysis}

We extracted the app's data folder from the Android device using TODO. Imo also
stores data in \texttt{/sdcard/DCIM/imo} and \texttt{/sdcard/IMO}. In those
folders, only videos and pictures are stored which are used in conversations or
stories.

In the data directory, we can find all our messages and contacts in the sqlite3
file \texttt{databases/imofriends.db}. All contacts have a \texttt{buid}, which
is numeric. Group chats have a non-numeric \texttt{buid}.

The table `messages' contains all messages, including whether a message was
delivered to the recipient's device and whether a message was read (the columns
\texttt{message\_state} and \texttt{message\_read} are set to `1' when
delivered and read, respectively).

The table `call\_timestamps' contains a convenient log of all calls placed
through the imo application. Only the start time is noted, together with the
contact which was called, not the end time or duration. This timestamp is in
unix format, in nanoseconds, in the UTC timezone. Missed calls are placed in
the `messages' table, as a chat message to the respective user.

The table `friends' contains your contacts. These are all the people you can
message and call. In contrast, the tables `imo\_phonebook', `phone\_numbers',
and `phonebook\_entries' contain the contacts of whom you have a number; these
contacts are the ones also in your Android contact list. It appears that you
are only able to see stories of the users of whom you have the number.

Outside of this database, other files also contain usage information. The JSON
file \texttt{files/brefs.json} contains a field named
\texttt{LAST\_APP\_OPEN\_TS}, which contains a timestamp of when the app was
last opened.


\subsection{Logged in user}

When signing up or logging in, one needs to enter a confirmation code sent by
SMS. The phone number entered is stored in
\texttt{files/VerificationPrefs.json}, even when the number is not yet
confirmed.

After confirming the number, it is stored in \texttt{files/bprefs.json}. The
JSON file contains a field named \texttt{GET\_MY\_PROFILE}, which is another
JSON string containing a field named \texttt{phone}.

This file also contains the fields \texttt{SIGNUP\_DATE} and
\texttt{SIGNUP\_TIME}, which contain the first time someone logged in with this
phone number and the last time you logged in on this device with this number,
respectively.


\subsection{Removing data}

When you delete a message from a chat in imo, the application deletes it from
the local database's `messages' table. Similarly, when you delete one of your
stories, it is truly deleted from the `stories' table. However, in the binary
data, we can still find the original message. By parsing the sqlite format, one
might be able to find other fields belonging to the message such as the
corresponding timestamp.

When removing a story, references to the story are not deleted. For example
when one replies to a story, an entry is created in the `messages' table which
refers to it by its object id. These rows are not deleted upon deletion of the
original story. When attempting to view the story in the application, it shows
the story as deleted.

When removing your account on imo, most of the local database tables are
cleared. The `call\_timestamps' table is, however, not cleared and still
contains all previous calls made on this device. Other tables, such as
`messages' and `friends', are cleared. Like with deleted messages, however, the
original data can still be found in the binary data of the sqlite file.


RANDOM NOTES
============

- One can log in multiple times with the same account from multiple devices, concurrently

- TODO: any sort of cache of Real-time-chat? People might chat through that and thereby never log any messages.

% \section{Methods and Scope}
%
% We will do both static and dynamic analysis of the application. We limit
% ourselves to the investigation of the imo Android application and do not look
% into the iOS, MacOS or Windows versions. We will look at the stable release,
% not any (potentially volatile) beta releases.
%
% The main point of interest is network traffic and stored data. If network data
% is not (correctly) encrypted or otherwise revealing, this could be useful in an
% active investigation. Stored data is useful for analysis after confiscating a
% device.
%
% To access both the image and network traffic, we will run the application in an
% Android emulator. This allows the host to capture traffic, as well as mount the
% disk image.
